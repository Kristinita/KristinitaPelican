# [NOTE] T003 — bad practice in my opinion, see 4.1 item:
# https://github.com/Riverside-Healthcare/djLint/issues/345#issue-1345158405
#
# [NOTE] H014 — bad practice in my opinion:
# https://github.com/Riverside-Healthcare/djLint/issues/341#issuecomment-1225671131
#
# [NOTE] H016 — I use “includes” and blocks,
# and may not use “title” in the one page with “html lang”
#
# [NOTE] H017 — bad practice in my opinion, see 4.2 item:
# https://github.com/Riverside-Healthcare/djLint/issues/345#issue-1345158405
# Google HTML/CSS Style Guide doesn’t recommend close void elements:
# https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Document_Type
#
# [NOTE] H025 — too strange rule without a single positive inclusion for me
#
# [NOTE] H030 — I use “includes” and blocks,
# and may not use meta tags in the one page with “html lang”
#
# [NOTE] H031 — “until 2009 for Google to publicly confirm
# that the meta keyword tag is no longer relevant for the ranking”,
# “Today, in contrast to the Meta Description and Meta Title,
# the meta keywords are often no longer filled with terms.”
