	Reasons:
		1. “element.innerHTML +=” is bad for web performance:

		2. I can do a hes-gallery script and styles uploading parallel, not sequential.
		This is a plus for a web-performance.
		3. Non-critical styles are best loaded with Defer.js:
		https://github.com/shinsenter/defer.js#Defer.css
		4. My experience shows that unpkg works less stable than JSDelivr.
		Site loading sometimes hangs due to slow unpkg.
