# [PURPOSE] Continuous integration for Windows:

platform: x64


# [REQUIRED] Visual Studio 2022 for correct LocalAppVeyor run:

# [NOTE] Don’t use SETX for adding value of “PATH” variable!

# [NOTE] Don’t use refreshenv in AppVeyor, if you use “SET” instead of “pathed”!
# You loss your environment variables:

# [LEARN][APPVEYOR] Build configuration:

install:

# [REQUIRED] So that script run for “master” branch, not for “HEAD”;
# Needs, that “grunt-checkbranch” works correct:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/18866140/5951529
# [NOTE] It needs in “install” section, because in “init” section actions before cloning.
- git checkout master

# [LEARN][APPVEYOR] Console (cmd.exe) is default terminal in AppVeyor.
# If needs PowerShell, “ps:” required:
# https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/
# [NOTE] For local Scoop installation must required:
# “Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser”
# http://scoop.sh/
- ps: iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')

# [NOTE][COMPARE] Required PATH changes to separated file, because “PATH” must be set before grunt-pylint installation:
